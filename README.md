# AI SDK Playground

This project is a playground for experimenting with various AI SDK tools and APIs, built using Next.js and TypeScript. It provides a modular structure for testing, demonstrating, and integrating different AI-powered features such as chat, image generation, speech synthesis, semantic search, and more.

## Features

- **Chat and Reasoning**: Interact with AI models for chat and advanced reasoning tasks.
- **Image Generation**: Generate images using AI models and tools.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Convert text to speech with AI-powered voice synthesis.
- **Semantic Search**: Perform semantic search over data using embeddings.
- **API Tooling**: Test and demonstrate various AI APIs and client-side tools.
- **Provider Management**: Manage and configure different AI providers and models.
- **Multi-modal and Structured Data**: Work with multi-modal AI and structured data arrays.
- **Transcription and Web Search**: Transcribe audio and perform AI-powered web searches.
